The Odin Project Fundamentals - Project: Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website created using HTML that will consist of a main index page which will have link sot a few recipes.

In this project I'll be demonstrating the current HTML knowledge I have learned from the Odin Project.

The 2nd part of this project is a revisit of the HTML code written in which CSS will be utilised to make it look more user friendly and interesting rather than a barebones HTML structure.
